# Student Performance Prediction Model Training Documentation

## Model Architecture Strategy

### Three-Tier Model System

**Tier 1: Critical Subject Models (Mathematics & English)**
- These require the most sophisticated modeling due to their WAEC gate-keeper status
- Higher feature complexity and ensemble approaches
- More frequent retraining cycles
- Stricter confidence threshold requirements

**Tier 2: Science Subject Models (Physics, Chemistry, Biology)**
- Moderate complexity models
- Share some features with Tier 1 but with subject-specific weightings
- Consider prerequisite relationships (e.g., Math performance impacts Physics)

**Tier 3: Arts/Social Science Models (Literature, Government, Economics, etc.)**
- Simpler models with broader feature sets
- Can use more generalized approaches
- Lower prediction urgency but still important for overall WAEC success

## Data Preparation Framework

### Feature Engineering by Subject Category

**For Mathematics Model:**
- Emphasize sequential topic mastery (Algebra → Geometry → Calculus progression)
- Weight problem-solving speed and accuracy separately
- Include anxiety/confidence indicators specific to quantitative subjects
- Track improvement velocity in mathematical reasoning
- Consider prerequisite knowledge gaps from earlier classes

**For English Language Model:**
- Focus on comprehensive skill areas: Reading, Writing, Oral, Grammar
- Weight continuous assessment vs. examination performance differently
- Include participation in language-rich activities (debates, presentations)
- Track vocabulary development and essay quality progression
- Consider first language interference patterns

**For Other Subjects:**
- Group by similarity (Sciences together, Arts together)
- Use domain-specific performance indicators
- Include subject-specific engagement metrics
- Consider teacher quality and resource availability per subject

### Universal Features Across All Models

**Academic Performance Indicators:**
- Term-by-term grade progression from SS2 to current
- Assignment completion rates and quality scores
- Class participation and attendance patterns
- Peer performance context (class ranking percentiles)

**Behavioral and Engagement Metrics:**
- Study time allocation per subject
- Help-seeking behavior frequency
- Extracurricular participation relevant to subject area
- Parent-teacher conference attendance and outcomes

**Institutional Context:**
- Teacher experience and qualification levels per subject
- Resource availability (labs, libraries, technology)
- Class size and student-teacher ratios
- School's historical WAEC performance in each subject

## Model Selection Criteria

### For Critical Subjects (Math & English)

**Primary Approach: Ensemble Methods**
- Combine multiple algorithms to reduce prediction variance
- Use cross-validation with temporal splits (train on earlier cohorts, validate on recent)
- Implement feature importance ranking to identify key predictors
- Build separate confidence calibration layers

**Algorithm Considerations:**
- Gradient boosting for capturing complex interactions between academic factors
- Random forests for handling mixed data types and missing values
- Neural networks for capturing non-linear progression patterns
- Logistic regression for interpretability and baseline comparison

### For Other Subjects

**Streamlined Approach:**
- Single best-performing algorithm per subject category
- Shared feature engineering pipelines within subject groups
- Simplified hyperparameter tuning process
- Focus on computational efficiency over marginal accuracy gains

## Training Methodology

### Data Split Strategy

**Temporal Validation:**
- Training: SS2 first term through SS3 first term data
- Validation: SS3 second term data
- Test: Final WAEC outcomes
- Never allow future data to leak into past predictions

**Cross-Subject Validation:**
- Ensure model performance is consistent across different subject combinations
- Test for interaction effects between subject predictions
- Validate that overall WAEC success probability makes sense

### Performance Metrics Framework

**For Critical Subjects:**
- Primary: Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) - measures discrimination ability
- Secondary: Precision at high-risk threshold (minimize false alarms)
- Tertiary: Recall at intervention threshold (don't miss at-risk students)
- Calibration: Brier score for confidence interval accuracy

**For Other Subjects:**
- Simplified metrics focusing on overall classification accuracy
- Emphasis on computational efficiency
- Acceptable trade-off between speed and precision

## Model Validation and Testing

### Validation Framework

**Historical Backtesting:**
- Test models on previous years' data if available
- Simulate real-time predictions at different points in academic year
- Measure prediction stability over time

**Cross-Cohort Validation:**
- Ensure models generalize across different student populations
- Test performance across different school contexts within private school segment
- Validate cultural and socioeconomic robustness

### Confidence Interval Calibration

**For All Models:**
- Implement probability calibration using Platt scaling or isotonic regression
- Ensure predicted probabilities match actual outcomes frequencies
- Build separate confidence models for different prediction horizons

## Implementation Considerations

### Model Deployment Strategy

**Tiered Deployment:**
- Deploy Critical Subject models first with highest computational resources
- Implement fallback mechanisms for when real-time data is unavailable
- Create model versioning system for A/B testing different approaches

**Update Frequency:**
- Critical Subjects: Monthly retraining during academic year
- Other Subjects: Term-based retraining
- Emergency retraining triggers when performance degrades beyond thresholds

### Privacy and Ethical Considerations

**Data Minimization:**
- Use only necessary features for each prediction task
- Implement feature anonymization where possible
- Build audit trails for all prediction decisions

**Bias Mitigation:**
- Test for gender, socioeconomic, and regional biases in predictions
- Implement fairness constraints in model training
- Regular bias auditing across different demographic groups

### Real-Time Monitoring Integration

**Anomaly Detection Alignment:**
- Ensure prediction models and anomaly detection systems use compatible feature sets
- Build feedback loops where anomaly detection informs prediction model updates
- Create unified dashboard showing both prediction confidence and recent anomaly alerts
